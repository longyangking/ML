    "Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of the machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive. The need for manual feature engineering can be obviated by automated feature learning.\n",

    "# Feature Learning\n",
    "In machine learning, feature learning or representation learning is a set of techniques that learn a feature: a transformation of raw data input to a representation that can be effectively exploited in machine learning tasks. This obviates manual feature engineering, which is otherwise necessary, and allows a machine to both learn at a specific task(_using_ the features) and learn the features themselves: to learn how to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often requires input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensor measurement is usually complex, redundant, and highly variable. Thus, it is necessary to discover useful features or representations from raw data. Traditional hand-crafted features often require expensive human labor and often rely on expert knowledge. Also, they normally do not generalize well. This motivates the design of efficient feature learning techniques, to automate and generalize this.\n",

    "# Feature Selection\n",
    "In machine learning and statistics, feature selection, also known as variable selection, attribute selection or variable subset selection, is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features(variables, predictors) for use in model construction. Feature selection techniques are used for three reasons:\n",
    "+ Simplification of models to make them easier to interpret by researchers/users\n",
    "+ Shorter training times\n",
    "+ Enhanced generalization by reducing overfitting(formally, reduction of variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "The central premise when using a feature selection techniques is that the data contains many features that are either _redundant_ or _irrelevant_, and can thus be removed without incurring much loss of information. _Redundant_ or _irrelevant_ features are two distinct notions, since one relevant feature may be redundant in the presence of another relevant feature with which it is strongly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection techniques should be distinguished from feature extraction. Feature extraction creates new features from functions of the original features, whereas feature selection returns a subset of the features. Feature selection techniques are often used in domains where there are many features and comparatively few samples(or data points). Archetypal cases for the application of feature selection include the analysis of written texts and DNA microarray data, where there are many thousands of features, and a few tens to hundreds of samples."
